I am a 1st year Ph.D. student in [CoAI Group](https://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Dept. of Computer Science and Technology of Tsinghua University. I’m advised by Prof. [Minlie Huang](https://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml). My research interests lie in LLM safety and trustworthy, and I’m recently working on the mechanism of jailbreaking attack & defense, hallucination and knowledge boundary of LLMs.
