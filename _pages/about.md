I am a 4th year undergraduate student of Dept. of Computer Science and Technology of Tsinghua University, Beijing, PRC. I am also an incomming Ph.D Student of Prof. [Minlie Huang](https://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml) @ [Conversational AI Group](https://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) starting from 2025 Fall. My research interests lie in LLM safety and alignment, and Iâ€™m recently working on the mechanism of jailbreak attack and defense of large language models.
